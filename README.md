Hello,

Welcome to Oxymusic.

This is a website for the Android music player app 'Oxymusic'.

To check this project out,you must do a few set up things.

First download the zip folder or clone the project into your local machine.

You want to open it with your favorite code editor.Cd into the root directory.That's where the backend of the website lives.
First you want to run a 'npm i' to download the server side dependencies.After that you also want to cd into the client folder and also run
an 'npm i' to install frontend depedencies. 

When that's all set,cd back  into the root folder and run 'npm run dev' to run both the client and backend simultaneously.

That's it.That's all there's to it.
